# SparkifyUserRetention
Design the data schema for Sparkify business and build predictive model for analyzing user retention



Goal: 
Sparkify is a straming music service. This project will be helping Sparkify to create a data pipline to generate the reporting dashboard and user retention prediction. The source data, which is the user activity log is stored in S3. The data pipeline will be designed for easier maintenance and it will be based on big data environment. 

Scope:
1. Design a dimension model based on its business   
2. Stage data in Redshift and process them to a data lake by Spark.
3. Configured data pipeline with Airflow
4. Build a model to predict the user retention using EMR
5. Create a Tableau Dashboard to analyze the user activity based on data from Redshift and prediction model from step 4
